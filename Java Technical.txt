Constructor
------------
when called constructor initialize the object.Used to initialize the object.Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.

Static keyword
---------------
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly.
cant override

this keyword
------------
This is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
-> to refer current class instance variable

If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.
If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.

abstract class

to implement abstraction concept.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

Interface	
---------
to implement abstraction concept.
also for multiple inheritance.

default and static method in interface since java 8.
marker interface- has no data member and method ( eg: Serializable, Cloneable, Remote, etc.)Their purpose is to "mark" or "tag" a class to provide some information about it to the runtime environment or to other parts of the program.


String
--------
String
String buffer
string builder
